* Stickiness for Emacs multi-term
This adds stickiness to multi-term buffers so that they stick to their own
windows.

** Why stickiness?
Multiple terminal buffers are quite useful but sometimes you loose track of how many
you have open. And its a bit annoying to cycle through them to find the one you are
looking for.

** When and How to use stickiness?
You decide but here's when it makes most sense:

*** Show all terminal buffers
If you need to see all terminal buffers(especially if you have plenty screen estate).
Use a toggle switch `multi-term-stickiness-toggle` or turn it on by default in your
Emacs configuration with `(multi-term-stickiness t)` 

*** Quickly switch between terminal buffers
If you have too many terminal buffers open, its easier to switch with sticky mode on.

1. If you're not already in sticky mode, turn it on `multi-term-stickiness-toggle`.
2. Switch to the buffer# of your choice or with `multi-term-next`/`multi-term-prev`.
3. Turn sticky mode off with the toggle switch, if it bothers you.

** Known Issues
multi-term pop up/out(with `shell-pop`) does not pop up/out all sticky terminal windows
together. A work around is to switch to the main multi-term window and then pop it out.
